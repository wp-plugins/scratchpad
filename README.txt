Scratchpad provides users with a running notepad while composing a post in Distraction Free Mode. Notes are saved along with the post!

== Description ==

Have you ever wanted to keep running notes when composing your posts ? Scratchpad is here to make composing easy and fast! Your notes are saved with the post you’re composing!


Scratchpad can be used to keep an outline for the post, visible next to the post, or to have a list of links or snippets to refer to.

[a]The validator fails without this link, what should it be ?
[b]We're not sure how to set this stable tag. The instruction said : ' Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable. ' Should this be 1.0?




More instructions we don't understand: Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt` is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.


 If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
[c]Should we add a ""Where can I report a bug" section and what's the best way to do that ?
